TITLE:
Basic Image Processing – Loading images, Cropping, Resizing, Thresholding, Contour analysis, Blob detection

AIM:
To perform basic image processing operations using OpenCV.

THEORY:
Basic image processing includes loading images, cropping specific area, resizing image, thresholding for segmentation, contour analysis for shape detection and blob detection for circular region detection.

PROCEDURE:
1) Load image using imread()
2) Display image using matplotlib or cv2.imshow()
3) Crop by slicing image[y1:y2, x1:x2]
4) Resize using cv2.resize()
5) Thresholding – example Otsu threshold
6) Contour analysis using cv2.findContours()
7) Blob detection using cv2.SimpleBlobDetector()

OUTPUT:
Images loaded, cropped, resized, thresholded, contours detected and blobs detected.

RESULT:
Basic image processing operations executed successfully using OpenCV.

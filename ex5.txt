TITLE:
Image Features and Image Alignment – Fourier, Hough, ORB features, Feature Matching, Cloning, Alignment

AIM:
To extract ORB features, match features and align images.

PROCEDURE:
1) Load two images (reference and target)
2) Convert to grayscale
3) Use ORB to detect keypoints and descriptors
4) Use BFMatcher for matching
5) Sort matches and take top matches
6) Estimate homography
7) Warp perspective to align

OUTPUT:
Aligned image obtained.

RESULT:
Image features extracted and image alignment completed successfully.
